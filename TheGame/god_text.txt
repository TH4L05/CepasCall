Hey kid, just making sure you arrived safe and sound! Now that you figured out how to walk on this land, you should learn how to defend yourself and the forest.
Do you see the[b][color=lime] robot [/color][/b]over there? That's one of your[b][color=lime] enemies[/color][/b]... obviously that one is broken, but it’ll do just fine to teach you how to use your magic.
Alright, go ahead and destroy the malfunctioning robot.
You did it! But what’s that? Can you hear it too? Sounds like you are getting unexpected visitors! Get ready and just repeat what you did to that broken robot.



Hey kid, have you seen this[b][color=lime] swarm of butterflies[/color][/b]? I think they want to show you something! Just[b][color=lime] follow [/color][/b]them and see where they'll take you!
Wow! Isn’t that beautiful?[b][color=lime] Glowing flowers [/color][/b]like this are called[b][color=lime] healing flowers[/color][/b]!
These plants can give you a lot of[b][color=lime] magical energy [/color][/b]back that you might lose during battle.[b][color=lime] Pink healing flowers [/color][/b]are pretty rare, but[b][color=lime] restore all [/color][/b]of your[b][color=lime] energy[/color][/b].[b][color=lime] Orange [/color][/b]ones[b][color=lime] restore [/color][/b]a[b][color=lime] small amount [/color][/b]of energy, but might bloom once you[b][color=lime]defeat an enemy[/color][/b]. 
That's how nature shows you how grateful it is for your help. To [b][color=lime]collect[/color][/b] healing flowers, you just need to [b][color=lime]walk over[/color][/b]them.

Oh ... don’t cry, kid. This is your very first mission after all, don’t beat yourself up! Do you want to[b][color=lime] try again [/color][/b]or do you want to[b][color=lime] quit [/color][/b]for today?
Incredible! I can’t believe this is your first mission, you make me look older than I am!
I am so proud of you, for coming this far. But listen carefully now, right behind this barricade is the heart of the forest. This is where you have to plant the magical tree seed and help it grow. But be careful, kid. There will be many enemies waiting for you.
